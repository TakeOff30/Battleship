# Battleship

## Simple game inspired by battleship made in vanilla javascript

This project helped me improve my coding practices and it is my first ever
project created by adopting a TDD philosophy. 
The user goes trougth 3 core phases: he enters his information, places the 
ships on the board and plays against a CPU. The cpu makes casual moves but
the plan is to implement an AI which interacts by picking the next best move 
by using game theory algorithms.
